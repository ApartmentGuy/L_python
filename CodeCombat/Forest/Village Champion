# stop all the ogres
# save all the peasants.
#Define a function in your code.
#
# The ogres have broken thorugh and opened another path
# into the village! You'll need to write your own function to handle this new attack
# look closely at how to define a function. You're on your own this time.

        # Incoming munchkins! Defend the town!

# # Incoming munchkins! Defend the town!


# Incoming munchkins! Defend the town!

# Define your own function to fight the enemy!
# In the function, find an enemy, then cleave or attack i
