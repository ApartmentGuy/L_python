#Use distanceTo() to find the range to each enemy, and use say()
#to call the range for your artillery.

# Then sit back and watch the fireworks.

# Ogres are scouting the forest!
# Use the distanceTo method to find where the enemies are.
#Say the distance for each enemy to tell the artillery where to fire
